    "## Exercise 5: Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA) for Lampahan Region\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a workflow for estimating earthquake hazard at the building level using open data and reproducible Python tools. The main steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defining the Area of Interest:**  \n",
    "    The Lampahan region is specified using a bounding box, and its geometry is visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downloading Building Footprints:**  \n",
    "    Building polygons are retrieved from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and plotted on the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fetching Earthquake Catalog:**  \n",
    "    Earthquake events since 1980 are downloaded from the USGS using the ObsPy FDSN client, filtered by magnitude and spatial extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Computing Distances:**  \n",
    "    Epicentral distances from each building centroid to each earthquake are calculated using the haversine formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ground Motion Prediction:**  \n",
    "    The Atkinson & Boore (2003) ground motion model (GMPE) is used to estimate the median peak ground acceleration (PGA) at each building for each event.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hazard Curve Calculation:**  \n",
    "    For each building, the mean annual frequency of exceedance (MAFE) for several PGA levels is computed, assuming each event is a Poisson process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Mapping:**  \n",
    "    The probability that PGA exceeds 0.2g in 50 years is mapped for all buildings, visualized both as a static plot and interactively with Folium.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise illustrates how open-source geospatial and seismological libraries can be combined for rapid, transparent hazard mapping at high spatial resolution. The workflow is modular and can be adapted for other regions, building datasets, or ground motion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code cell ensures that all required Python packages for seismic hazard analysis are installed and available in the notebook environment. It checks for each package, installs any missing ones using `pip`, and imports them for use in subsequent cells. This step helps maintain reproducibility and prevents runtime errors due to missing dependencies."

    "# Interactive Seismic Hazard Mapping with Folium\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell creates an interactive map of the Lampahan region using Folium, displaying the probability that each building will experience peak ground acceleration (PGA) greater than 0.2g in the next 50 years. Buildings are color-coded according to their exceedance probability, with a capped color scale for readability. Users can zoom and pan to explore spatial patterns of seismic risk at the building level. Tooltips provide detailed probability values for each building footprint."

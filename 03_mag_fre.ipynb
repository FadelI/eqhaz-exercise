    "# Exercise 3: Earthquake Magnitude-Frequency Analysis Near Antananarivo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to analyze the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes near Antananarivo, Madagascar, using real earthquake catalog data. The workflow includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Acquisition:** Earthquake events are fetched from the USGS catalog for a region surrounding Antananarivo, defined by latitude and longitude bounds, and filtered by minimum magnitude.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning:** Events with missing depth or magnitude information are removed to ensure data quality.\n",
    "- **Distance Calculation:** The haversine formula is used to compute the distance from each earthquake to Antananarivo.\n",
    "- **Magnitude Binning:** Earthquake magnitudes are grouped into bins (0.5 increments), and the number of events in each bin is counted.\n",
    "- **Magnitude-Frequency Distribution:** The cumulative number of events above each magnitude threshold is calculated and visualized, showing the typical decrease in frequency with increasing magnitude.\n",
    "- **Gutenberg-Richter Law Fitting:** The Gutenberg-Richter relation (`log10(N) = a - b*M`) is fitted to the magnitude-frequency data, providing estimates for the parameters `a` and `b` that characterize the seismicity of the region.\n",
    "- **Data Filtering:** The analysis is repeated for events with magnitude ≥ 4.0 to focus on more significant earthquakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise illustrates key concepts in seismology and statistical analysis, including catalog querying, data wrangling, binning, cumulative distributions, and linear regression fitting for empirical laws. The workflow is modular and can be adapted to other regions or magnitude thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install the required packages."

    "We will focus the analysis on a more complete record and impactful seismic events, we filter the earthquake catalog to include only those with magnitude greater than or equal to 4.0. Events with magnitude less than 4.0 are fewer and missing, which does not match the general observation that the number of earthquakes increases as the magnitude decreases. This is mainly related to the lack or limited number of seismological stations in the region. This step reduces the influence of smaller, less significant earthquakes and allows for a clearer examination of the magnitude-frequency relationship among moderate and large events. The filtered dataset is used to recalculate magnitude bins, cumulative counts, and to visualize the updated magnitude-frequency distribution. This targeted approach provides more meaningful insights into the seismic hazard near Antananarivo."
